TINET: A Transfer Learning Framework for Invariant Networks
======================

Project Introduction
--------

The invariant network has shown to be a powerful way of characterizing complex system behaviors. 
However,due to the dynamic and complex nature of real-world information systems, learning a reliable invariant network in a new environment often requires continuous collecting and analyzing the system surveillance data for several weeks or even months. 
To avoid the prohibitive time and resource consuming network building process, we propose TINET, a knowledge transfer based model for accelerating invariant network construction. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TINET.

Organization
--------

The code for the TINET in the code/ directory, but it is currentlly not available.
The Synthetic Data is located in Data/Synthetic_Data/ directory, and the real-world data is located in Data/Real_Data directory.
